# Python-Webscraper
Python program which pulls some data from a site and displays the characters

## Challenge code
this was set as a challenge to assess my programing for an AI training company

I have limited experience with Python, mostly focused around teaching introduction to programming classes in secondary schools. So I approached this project as a way to learn the language.

### Use of AI
Having no prior experience in writing programs to scrape websites, ChatGPT was used to discover the tool used, BeautifulSoup. I also used it to confirm the correct usage for some of the commands.
